/**
 * Command line program to capture a still frame and encode it to file.
 * Also optionally display a preview/viewfinder of current camera input.
 *
 * Description
 *
 * 3 components are created; camera, preview and JPG encoder.
 * Camera component has three ports, preview, video and stills.
 * This program connects preview and stills to the preview and jpg
 * encoder. Using mmal we don't need to worry about buffers between these
 * components, but we do need to handle buffers from the encoder, which
 * are simply written straight to the file in the requisite buffer callback.
 *
 * We use the RaspiCamControl code to handle the specific camera settings.
